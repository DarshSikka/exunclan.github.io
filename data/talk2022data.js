    title: 'Effective Real-World Scientific Computing',
    para:
      'Research in physics and astronomy depends heavily on computation, but researchers often have to teach themselves key skills and concepts. This includes many techniques for faster computation, better algorithm design, or easier programming work styles. This talk will introduce some key computational ideas that are helpful to physicists, and how they can be implemented using the Julia programming language. Vectorizing problems, just-in-time compilation, hardware acceleration, using efficient algorithms and methods, and common real-world science issues will be covered. No programming experience is required, and examples will mostly be diagrams or pseudocode.',
